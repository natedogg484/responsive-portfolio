            <p>
                I've always wanted to have a job in which I was creating or building something. I took a Computer
                Science course in college in which we worked in Windows Basic and I really enjoyed coding. It really
                made me feel as if I was able to make something. In the long term, working for a gaming company would
                be my ideal job, but anything that will allow me to learn, grow, and develop will make me happy.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the personal side I enjoy gaming, snowboarding/skiing, exercising, competing in Spartan Races, and
                spending time at home with my lady and our cats.
                I really want to go snowboarding out in the Western United States, Europe, and some other places
                throughout the world and definitely plan on doing that
                in the future. I hope to master coding so that I can someday play a game that I created.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am an animal lover at heart, and ever since I was young cats have been my favorite. I think I enjoy
                their reclusiveness because it takes work to earn and keep their trust
                but once you have it they are great and loving animals. Plus, they don't bark.
